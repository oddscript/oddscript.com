When you start your journey into the world of building things for the web you might at some point ask yourself this question: What is the difference between web design and web development? Iâ€™ll try to answer that in this article.

## Web design
A web designer is responsible for the visual part of a web site i.e. how it looks and how the information is distributed. Therefore a web designer should have visual design skills and also knowledge about usability, so that the end product becomes easy to use. 
These are the skills and technologies used as a web designer: 
- Design skills
- Usability
- User experience (UX)
- Photo editing software (Usually Photoshop)
- Design & Illustration software (Usually things like Sketch or Illustrator)

## Web development
A web developer on the other hand is responsible for turning the design into something useful. There is usually two types of web developers, frontend and backend developers. These two work on the two different parts of the web stack, namely browser and server.

### Frontend developer
The frontend developer is responsible for the code that will be run by the browser. There are usually some overlap between a frontend developer and a web designer in the sense that a frontend developer have some web designer skills. 
These are the basic skills and technologies used as a frontend developer:
- Basic design skills
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Browser development tools 

### Backend developer
The backend developer is responsible for building code that is running on the server and talks to databases. Technologies that a backend developer might use are Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Java, Go and so on.
These are the basic skills and technologies used as a frontend developer:
- A programming language (Python, PHP, Javascript and so on)
- A database technology (MySQL, MongoDB and so on)
- Basic knowledge about web servers

### Full-stack developer
There is a third kind of developer, namely the full-stack developer. This developer type knows about both frontend and backend. A full-stack developer probably also know a bit about web design as well.

## So what should you choose?
It all comes down to what you prefer to work with. Do you prefer design and creativity over logic and problem solving? In either case you should probably learn a bit of both since you will be working with the other type regardless if you are a web designer or a web developer, and if you know a bit about what the other type do then you will be better at communicating and building the things together. If you on the other hand want to work completely by yourself or be the king in the office; go for full-stack plus designer if you can pull it off and be good at all parts.

## Web development books
If you want to be a web developer you should really consider checking out my upcoming book-series/bundle How to become a web developer. It will teach you how to become a web developer from scratch. The first book talks about some basic computer science that is useful for web developers. If you want to get notified when the first book is available sign up for my newsletter.
