Ok, most people have an idea of what a computer is and maybe so do you. This is an article to get you up to speed if you don’t. If you feel certain that you know, skim through it and wait for the next article in the How computers work series.

## The definition of a computer
A computer is a machine that computes (a.k.a *calculates*) stuff. It takes in data (*inputs*), does something to that data (*calculation*) based on instructions (*program*), and then it finally spits out whatever it is that it was told to (*output*). So the process looks a bit like this:

**Input** -> **Calculation** (Based on a program) -> **Output**

Worth noting is that a computer is useless if it does not have a program, without it the computer can’t do anything. There is two ways to program a computer. The first way is to hardwire the program into the actual physical circuit (called *logic circuitry*) or it can be loaded into memory by a user (called *software*). 

## Hardware vs. Software
- **Hardware** is the physical components of a computer, and in some cases it is actually the whole computer (in the case of logic circuitry). Every computer needs hardware for each step of the computing process (see above). *Input devices* are keyboard, mouse devices, touch-screens, microphones, accelerometers and so on. The *calculation device* is often called a processor. At last you have your *output devices* like displays, speakers and other devices that can communicate to your senses.
Most computers you have used also has *memory* and *storage devices* of some kind to store information and programs.

- **Software** is the programs that are loaded into the hardware. This can be your operating system (mac, windows, android, iOS), apps and games. Software is usually programmed in programming languages like C, C++, Java, Javascript and so on. All instructions programmed in these language gets converted into machine code (binary, the ones and zeros) at some point so the computer can understand it.

## Different types of computers

Computers are everywhere today, all from small specialized devices like a remote to the internet is based off of computers. Here is just a small list of typical computers:

- Desktop computers
- Laptop computers
- Mobile Phones (yes, even the older ones that are not considered smartphones)
- Your microwave
- Tablets
- Servers (The internet is based on these)

## Lastly
So that was a really broad overview of what a computer is. In the next article in this series we are going to dive a little bit deeper into how the computer process and store information. So stay tuned for that!
